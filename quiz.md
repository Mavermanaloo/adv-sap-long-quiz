## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a way of developing software for the whole company that uses services, which are repeatable software parts. Each service has the code and data connections needed to do a certain business job, like checking a customer's credit, processing a mortgage application, or signing up for a website.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
The characteristic of SOA is Loose Coupling, a coupling between services is encouraged by SOA. In other words, each service works on its own and doesn't need to know a lot about the other services in the system. Interoperability means SOA stresses compatibility, which means that services can talk to and interact with each other no matter what computer languages, platforms, or tools they use. Reusability means SOA services are made to be used again and again. Services are groups of business concepts or functions that can be called on by different apps or processes across a company.
3.Define Microservices.
Microservices designs are made up of specialized, loosely linked, and replaceable parts, just like SOA. Microservices aren't usually used across the whole company, though. Instead, they're used to build individual apps in a way that makes them more flexible, scalable, and reliable. 
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Since microservices are separate, they can be set up and fixed more quickly. It's scalable because each microservice is its own thing and can be started and grow on its own. This lets companies change the size of some services based on demand without having to change the whole app. It can be built and used more quickly. When you use microservices, you get a lot of benefits, such as the fact that it's easy to fix and maintain.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
The similarities of these two is that Microservices and service-oriented architecture (SOA) both make it easy for development teams to create, launch, and run modern cloud apps. Still, there are some ways that microservices are better than SOA operations and Scope is the main difference between the two methods. to Simply put, the service-oriented architecture (SOA) is for the whole business, while the microservices design is for a single program.

6. Define Web Services.
A web service refers to software that is accessible via the internet and utilizes a standardized message protocol. Web services are autonomous, modular, distributed, and dynamic applications that may be characterized, made available, discovered, or called upon over a network in order to facilitate the creation of goods, processes, and supply chains. A web service is a set of publicly available protocols and standards that facilitate the exchange of data between different applications or systems. Software applications developed in different programming languages and operating on different platforms may use web services to exchange data via computer networks, such as the Internet, in a manner akin to inter-process communication on a single machine.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
Exposing the Existing Function on the network - Web services are HTTP-invoked managed code. It may be triggered over HTTP. Web services provide code functionality across the network. After being exposed on the network, other programs may utilize your software.
Interoperability - The ability to converse and share data and services is made possible via web services. It's possible that other apps will use web services. A Java web service may be communicated with by a Visual Basic or.NET application, and vice versa. Applications may become platform- and technology-independent through the use of web services.
Standardized Protocol - Web services communicate using industry-standard protocol. Web services protocol stack layers Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description, and Service Discovery employ well-defined protocols. This protocol stack standardization affords the firm various benefits, including more options, lower costs due to competition, and higher quality.
Low-Cost Communication - You may use your low-cost internet connection to create web services since they employ SOAP over HTTP. These technologies are more cost-effective than proprietary alternatives such as EDI/B2B. Web services may be constructed using either FTP or SOAP over HTTP.
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
XML-Based - XML is used by web services at both the data description and data transport stages. When you use XML, you don't have to worry about networking, operating systems, or platforms. At their core, web services-based tools can work with a lot of other programs.
Loosely Coupled - A web service customer is not directly bound to that specific web service. The web service interface can evolve over time without impacting the client's ability to engage with the service. A tightly linked system refers to a situation where the client and server logic are strongly interconnected, meaning that every modification to one interface requires a corresponding update to the other.
Coarse-Grained - Object-oriented languages, like Java, make their services available through separate methods. One way to do this is to find a business that can do anything useful at the company level. Java's APIs and the businesses that use them should be very broad. Web services technology makes it easy to set up large-scale services that can access just the right amount of business logic.
Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - Synchronicity involves the connection between the client and the execution of the service. During synchronous invocations, the client pauses and remains idle until the service finishes its action before proceeding.
Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) - Web services use an XML-based interface to let clients call processes, functions, and methods on remote objects. A web service must be able to handle the input and output factors that are shown by remote processes.
Supports Document Exchange - XML's general representation of data and complicated texts is a major benefit. These papers might reflect a current location or a book or RFQ. Web services provide transparent document interchange for corporate integration.
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
Provider - The provider creates the web service and makes it available to client applications who want to use it. 
Requestor - A requestor refers to the client application that requires communication with a web service. The client application may be developed using many programming languages such as .Net, Java, or any other language. It is designed to use the capabilities provided by a web service.

Broker - A broker is a software program that grants access to the UDDI. The UDDI, as previously mentioned, allows the client application to efficiently find and access the desired web service.

10.List and discuss the Web Services Components.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) - SOAP is a protocol that uses XML to facilitate the exchange of information between computers. SOAP is an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is a communication protocol that facilitates communication across different applications. It is compatible with all operating systems. The text explains the process of encoding an HTTP header and an XML file to facilitate communication between two machines. It is platform-agnostic and language-agnostic. It has the advantage of enabling server firewalls.
WSDL - Web Services Description Language (WSDL).  It is a language based on XML and written in XML.  It is used to delineate online services and the act of accessing them. It is an important part of UDDI that lets companies list themselves and their services on the Internet. It facilitates the navigation of people and other enterprises to access the service.
UDDI - UDDI is a standard for describing, posting, and finding web services that is based on XML.  Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration is what it stands for.  It's an open system that works on any device.  Along with SOAP and WSDL, it is seen as one of the three main standards for web services. It talks about how to connect to web services using WSDL. It is a plan for a web service registry that is spread out.
